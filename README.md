- ```hello``` First project created from command prompt after installation. **Prints Hello World!**, this program also contains Transposing of the matrix task from ***2.2 Tupils***
- ```Debug``` From 1.2.2 Display-
   - **Activity** <br />
After checking the output of the above example, use the Point2D struct as a guide to add a Complex struct to the example. When printed in the same way, the output should be:
``` Display: 3.3 + 7.2i```
   ``` Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, imag: 7.2 }```
- ```1.1-List``` From 1.2.2 Display>Testcase:List-
   - **Activity** <br />
Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also printed. The new output should look like this:
```[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3]```
- ```2 Matrix``` From 1.2 Formatted print-
   - **Activity** <br />
Add a println! macro call that ```prints: Pi is roughly 3.142``` by controlling the number of decimal places shown. For the purposes of this exercise, use ```let pi = 3.141592``` as an estimate for pi. (Hint: you may need to check the std::fmt documentation for setting the number of decimals to display)
- ```3 Structs``` From 3.1 Stuctures-
   - **Activity** <br />
Add a function rect_area which calculates the area of a Rectangle (try using nested destructuring).
- ```3.1 use``` From 3.2 Enums>3.2.1 use
  - this one didn't have an activity, I just did this because I wanted to try use crate::enum and cast as integers.
- ```6 Conversions``` This project contains of ```TryFrom``` ```TryInto``` for converting between types. Have used match, If let and assert_eq! to check here.
